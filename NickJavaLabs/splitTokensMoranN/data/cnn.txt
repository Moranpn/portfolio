The woman was Illinoisâ€™ first confirmed travel-associated case and was diagnosed after returning from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak originated. The husband, who did not travel to China, was the first confirmed case of person-to-person transmission of the virus in the United States, according the CDC. A cruise ship docked this morning near New York City as some passengers have a history of travel to China. Twenty-three passengers were cleared, and four are being evaluated at an area hospital after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention boarded the cruise ship to evaluate the situation.
